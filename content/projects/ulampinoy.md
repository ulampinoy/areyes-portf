### Work Done

Complete visual design, web development, branding, photography, video production, illustrations, icon design and copy writing.

The challenge is to make a supplementary website for our thriving YouTube cooking channel. Providing more detailed information on the cook-along video recipes we produce and explore the possiblity of using it for extra revenue such as ads placements and merch such as T-shirts, mugs and tote bags.

The design goal is to highlight the how-to cook videos and food photography. The majority of users are on tablet and smartphones so the implementation was mobile-first.
