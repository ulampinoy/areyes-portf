### Work Done

Complete visual design, web development, branding, photography, video production, illustrations, icon design and copy writing.

The challenge is to make a supplementary website to our thriving YouTube cooking channel. Providing more detailed information on the cook-along video recipes we produce and explore the possiblity of using it for extra revenue such as ads placements and merch such as T-shirts, mugs and aprons.

The design goal is to highlight the videos and food photography. The majority of users are on tablet and smartphones so the implementation was mobile-first.
