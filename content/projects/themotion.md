### Work Done

User experience design and UI development for user-facing products and internal applications. Work part of the engineering team and work closely with the product owner to prototype workflows, test and build user experiences.

When I joined the company, they have working MVP but the back-office is a barebone UI and there was a command line interface (CLI) only for generating dynamic video ads from what was called a VideoFactory.

The challenge is create a self-serve product so user can generate video ads from their existing product catalogs, launch the campaign to social media platforms such as Facebook and then manage it.

### Prototyping
After the defination and validation of techinal requirements,
a low fidelity mockup of the app was produced exploring the feature flow, information structure and navigation.
