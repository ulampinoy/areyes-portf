### Web Design Work

Landing page for AirGateway's new app â€” Bookingpad. I created the layout and design of the webpage in Figma, then hand-code the using plain HTML and CSS. A bit of JavaScript for the carousel of airline logos. The site was generated using Jekyll and I deployed the site via Netlify hooked to a GitHub repo.
